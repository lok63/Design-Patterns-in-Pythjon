# Python Singleton Patterns: Pitfalls and Best Practices

Singletons are a classic design pattern used to ensure a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. In Python, there are several ways to implement a singleton, each with its own trade-offs. This post walks through the most common approaches, their pitfalls, and best practices for robust singleton design.

## 1. Why Use a Singleton?

Sometimes you need a single, shared resource—like a configuration manager, logger, or database connection. The singleton pattern ensures only one instance of such a class exists, and that all code uses the same instance.

---

## 2. What is a Decorator and Why Use It?

A **decorator** in Python is a function that takes another function or class and returns a modified version of it. Decorators are a powerful way to add reusable behavior to classes or functions without modifying their code directly.

For singletons, a decorator can wrap a class so that only one instance is ever created, regardless of how many times you instantiate it.

---

## 3. The Classic `__new__` Singleton

The most basic way to implement a singleton in Python is to override the `__new__` method:

```python
class ConfigManager:
    _instance = None
    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

    def __init__(self):
        print("ConfigManager __init__ called")
```

**How it works:**
- `__new__` ensures only one instance is created.
- Every call to `ConfigManager()` returns the same object.

---

## 4. The `__init__` Pitfall

**Limitation:** Even though `__new__` returns the same instance, **`__init__` is called every time you instantiate the class**. This can lead to bugs if your constructor modifies state or performs side effects.

**Example:**
```python
c1 = ConfigManager()
c2 = ConfigManager()
# Both are the same instance, but __init__ runs twice!
```

---

## 5. Singleton with a Decorator

A decorator can be used to enforce the singleton pattern:

```python
def singleton_decorator(cls):
    instances = {}
    def get_instance(*args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in instances:
            instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[cls]
    return get_instance

@singleton_decorator
class ConfigManager:
    def __init__(self):
        print("ConfigManager __init__ called")
```

**How it works:**
- The decorator wraps the class, ensuring only one instance is created.
- `__init__` is only called once.

---

## 6. Decorator Limitations

While the decorator approach is simple, it comes with two major issues:

### 6.1. Inheritance Issue

When you decorate a class with a singleton decorator, the class becomes a function, not a type. This means:
- You cannot subclass the decorated class (subclassing raises a `TypeError`).
- `isinstance` and `issubclass` checks do not work as expected.

**Example:**
```python
def singleton_decorator(cls):
    ... # as above
    return get_instance

@singleton_decorator
class Logger:
    pass

# This will fail:
class FileLogger(Logger):
    pass
# TypeError: function() argument 'code' must be code, not str
```

### 6.2. Not Thread-Safe

In multi-threaded code, two threads can create two instances if they race to check for the instance at the same time. The decorator is not thread-safe by default.

**Example:**
```python
def singleton_decorator(cls):
    instances = {}
    def get_instance(*args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in instances:
            # Simulate a race condition
            import time; time.sleep(0.01)
            instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[cls]
    return get_instance

@singleton_decorator
class Database:
    pass

import threading
results = []
def create_instance():
    results.append(Database())
threads = [threading.Thread(target=create_instance) for _ in range(5)]
for t in threads: t.start()
for t in threads: t.join()
print("Unique instances:", len(set(id(obj) for obj in results)))  # May be > 1!
```

**How to fix:** Use a lock in the decorator or use a metaclass-based singleton.

---

## 7. Singleton with a Metaclass

A metaclass can enforce the singleton pattern while preserving class identity and supporting inheritance:

```python
import threading
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    _lock = threading.Lock()  # For thread safety

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        with cls._lock:
            if cls not in cls._instances:
                cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

class ConfigManager(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        print("ConfigManager __init__ called")
```

**How it works:**
- The metaclass controls instance creation, ensuring only one instance per class.
- **Solves all three issues:**
  - Only one instance is created and `__init__` is called once.
  - Inheritance works as expected (`isinstance`, `issubclass`, subclassing).
  - Thread safety is easy to implement with a lock.

## 8. Summary Table and Recommendations

| Aspect            | Decorator         | Metaclass         |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Simplicity        | ✅ Easy          | ❌ More complex   |
| Reusability       | ✅ Easy          | ✅ Easy           |
| Inheritance       | ❌ Issues        | ✅ Works          |
| Class Methods     | ❌ Class is func | ✅ Preserved      |
| Thread Safety     | ⚠️ Manual       | ✅ Easy           |
| Multiple Inheritance | ✅ No conflicts | ⚠️ Possible conflicts |

**Recommendations:**
- Use a decorator for simple, single-class singletons or when team familiarity with metaclasses is low.
- Use a metaclass for complex applications, inheritance, or when you need thread safety.

---

## 9. Summary

- Use the `__new__` approach for simple cases, but beware of the `__init__` pitfall.
- Decorators are simple but break inheritance and are not thread-safe.
- Metaclasses are the most robust and flexible solution for singletons in Python.

**Choose the approach that best fits your needs, and be aware of the trade-offs!**
